## Contents of the GitHub: 
### Validation/Visualization Python Scripts (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_package/tree/main/validation_scripts)
#### Jet-A Fuel 
Within the "validation scripts directory (link above) there is a Python script called "Jet_A_validation_tool" (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_tool/blob/main/validation_scripts/jetA_validation_tool.py). This script contains the code used to generate the Jet-A fuel validation and visualization packages. 
#### Hydrogen 
The "validation_scripts" (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_package/tree/main/validation_scripts) directory also contains a Python Script called "H2_validation_tool". This script contains the code used to generate the Hydrogen visualization package. 
#### Template 
Lastly, the "validation_scripts" (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_package/tree/main/validation_scripts) directory contains a Python Script called "validation_tool_(template). This script contains a general code for generating a validation/visualization package, where the lines enclosed in the symbol "!" indicate the fields that should be input by the user to complete the script for the selected fuel. 

### Data Files
#### Jet-A Fuel
The jetA_data directory (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_tool/tree/main/jetA_data) contains the .csv files used to generate the validation/visualization packages for Jet-A fuel with the Jet-A validation Python script. All of the .csv files contained in this folder are called and read by Python in the validation script to plot the data directly from these files. 
#### Hydrogen
The hydrogen_data directory (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_tool/tree/main/hydrogen_data) contains the .csv files used to generate the visualization packages for Hydrogen with the Hydrogen validation Python script. All of the .csv files contained in this folder are called and read by Python in the validation script to plot the data directly from these files. 

### Validation/Visualization Packages
#### Jet-A Fuel
The jetA_validation_package directory (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_tool/tree/main/jetA_validation_package) contains folders each named after the .csv data files that contain data for Jet-A fuel properties. Each of these folders contain validation/visualization plots from the corresponding .csv data file.
#### Hydrogen
Similarly, the H2_validation_package directory (https://github.com/hallaali/property_validation_tool/tree/main/H2_validation_package) contains folders each named after the .csv data files that contain data for Hydrogen properties. Each of these folders contain visualization plots from the corresponding .csv data file.

## How to Use the Python-Based Property Validation Tool: 

### Using the Thermo Rig to Generate Data

### Generating the Python Validation Script for a Selected Fuel

### Running the Python Script from the Command Line
